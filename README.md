# YouTube Timer Chrome Extension
A chrome extension that notifies you when you've reached a certain daily limit for watch time on YouTube. A timer appears above the video.
This extension is valuable because **it tracks watch time** on videos, so it does not count time spent browsing YouTube, unlike other productivity Chrome extensions.
## How to Use
These instructions are for Windows. It should be similar for other systems.
1. Download and extract the .zip file (click the green "Code" button in the upper right corner)
2. In the extracted folder, open "youtubeTimer.js" and change the number in the first line to your desired daily limit.
2. Open Chrome Extensions: In Chrome, click the puzzle piece in the upper right corner -> Manage Extensions.
3. Turn on the Developer mode switch in the upper right.
4. Click "Load Unpacked"
5. Navigate into the folder from the zip file you extracted and click "Select Folder"
6. The extension "Daily YouTube Timer" should appear in your list of extensions and be activated
7. Refreshing YouTube or closing Chrome may be necessary when using for the first time
## Known issues to keep in mind
- The timer will not be accurate if you have videos open in multiple tabs
- Sometimes the timer does not appear (refreshing the page should work). If it doesn't appear, it will not track time.
- The timer will not reset to 0 if YouTube is open at midnight
- The timer probably won't be shared between devices if the extension is used on multiple devices (hasn't been tested)
- If you change the video's playback speed, the timer will change speed too (it will no longer track real time)
Unfortunately I don't have the capacity and/or skills to fix these issues.
## Tips
- Press the = key to manually set the timer.
- Use YouTube in a different browser like Firefox (or in Chrome's "Guest mode") if you don't want watch time to be tracked (ex. listening to music)
- For mobile devices: the YouTube app has a feature to set reminders for time spent in the app (it tracks all time spent in the app, unlike this extension that only tracks watch time)
